Fair Duelist - Customizable Difficulty

Download the Vortex archive (https://github.com/my-mods/Fair-Duelist-Customizable-Difficulty/raw/refs/heads/main/Fair-Duelist-Customizable-Difficulty.zip)

Customize enemy health, damage, combat stamina costs and enemy attack delays. Start from Story, Fair, Challenging or Duelist, then adjust individual values. You can use the optional Mod Setting Menu or edit settings.ini yourself.

Requirements

- Required: UE4SS for BoD (https://www.nexusmods.com/thebloodofdawnwalker/mods/283). Install a version compatible with your game build. This version of Fair Duelist uses Lua for all balance changes.
- Optional: Mod Setting Menu 1.0.5.1 or later (https://www.nexusmods.com/thebloodofdawnwalker/mods/271). Adds in-game controls for the same settings.ini file. Fair Duelist works without it.


Default values and what the percentages mean

On a fresh installation, Fair Duelist creates settings.ini during startup as soon as the game's difficulty settings are ready, so you can configure it from the main menu before loading a save. The initial values match your selected RPG and Action difficulties. If those difficulties differ, their respective values are combined. Gameplay applies your saved choices when you load a save.

100% means the unscaled game value, 50% means half, and 150% means one and a half times. These percentages are absolute, not additional multipliers on top of the selected difficulty. All six percentage settings accept values from 0 to 500. Enter 75 for 75%, not 0.75 or 75%.

The six balance values are: enemy health / enemy damage / combat stamina cost / normal attack delay / low-health attack delay / ranged attack delay.

- Story: health 50%, damage 40%, stamina cost 50%; normal, low-health and ranged attack delays 200%. Attacks while another enemy blocks: Off.
- Fair: health 100%, damage 100%, stamina cost 100%; normal delay 140%, low-health delay 120%, ranged delay 140%. Attacks while another enemy blocks: Off.
- Challenging: health 100%, damage 130%, stamina cost 150%; normal delay 120%, low-health delay 100%, ranged delay 120%. Attacks while another enemy blocks: On.
- Duelist: health 90%, damage 160%, stamina cost 175%; normal delay 100%, low-health delay 60%, ranged delay 100%. Attacks while another enemy blocks: On.


The balance override starts On and Logging starts Off. Reset in Mod Settings uses the Duelist values above. Outdated or invalid settings files also reset to those defaults.

Lower health means enemies take fewer hits; lower damage means you take less damage; lower stamina cost makes combat actions cheaper. Lower attack-delay percentages let enemies attack more frequently; higher values give longer waits. Low-health and ranged delays control those specific attack cooldowns. These settings do not change attack animation speed or parry timing. The coordinated-attack switch allows an enemy to attack while another enemy is reacting to a block.

Change settings without Mod Setting Menu

- Install UE4SS and Fair Duelist, start the game, and wait for the main menu to create settings.ini. Then fully close the game.
- Open the game's installation folder. In Steam, right-click the game, then choose Manage > Browse local files.
- Open the file below with Notepad. Back it up before editing.


ini
Dawnwalker\Binaries\Win64\ue4ss\Mods\FairDuelist\settings.ini


Edit the existing values under [Settings]. Keep every generated key and the section heading. Do not edit mod_settings.ini, the files in Scripts, or the old %LOCALAPPDATA%\Dawnwalker\Saved\Config\FairDuelist.ini; that old INI is no longer read.

This is a complete Duelist-default example; your generated numbers may differ because they start from your selected game difficulties. Change only the values you want in your existing file:

ini
[Settings]
settingsVersion = 2
enabled = 1
difficultyPreset = 3
enemyHealthPercent = 90
enemyDamagePercent = 160
staminaCostPercent = 175
attackDelayPercent = 100
lowHealthAttackDelayPercent = 60
rangedAttackDelayPercent = 100
attackDuringBlock = 1
debugLogging = 0



Keep settingsVersion at 2. Leave the generated difficultyPreset line in place; changing that number does not select a preset. Choose presets through the game's own difficulty settings. For the three switches, 1 means On and 0 means Off. Setting enabled to 0 disables the custom balance override. Leave debugLogging at 0 for normal play. Decimal percentages such as 73.25 are accepted.

Example: shorter fights with Fair damage, stamina costs and attack delays. Set enemyHealthPercent to 75, enemyDamagePercent and staminaCostPercent to 100, attackDelayPercent and rangedAttackDelayPercent to 140, lowHealthAttackDelayPercent to 120, and attackDuringBlock to 0. Keep enabled at 1. This gives enemies 25% less health than Fair.

Save the file, restart the game, and load a save to use your changes. Do not leave values commented out, duplicate keys, or enter values outside their ranges: an obsolete or invalid file is replaced in full with Duelist defaults.

Change settings with the optional Mod Setting Menu

From the main menu, open Mod Settings > Fair Duelist - Customizable Difficulty. Adjust the controls, press Apply, and load a save to apply that snapshot to gameplay. Percentage sliders move in 5-point steps. Restore discards unapplied changes; Reset loads Duelist defaults. Logging is the final control.

Choosing another difficulty

Confirming a difficulty in the game's settings replaces the corresponding custom values in settings.ini. A full preset resets all balance values; RPG Difficulty resets health, damage and stamina costs; Action Difficulty resets attack delays and attacks while another enemy blocks. Canceling an unconfirmed preview preserves your saved values. To customize a new starting preset, confirm it first, then make your edits. Other game options, including indicators and parry settings, remain controlled by the game's difficulty settings.

Installation

- Vortex: Install Fair-Duelist-Customizable-Difficulty.zip through Vortex, enable it and deploy.
- Manual: Copy the archive's Dawnwalker folder into ...\steamapps\common\The Blood of Dawnwalker\, preserving the folder structure.

Logging

Logging is the final menu control. Leave it Off for normal play; On writes troubleshooting details to Dawnwalker\Binaries\Win64\ue4ss\UE4SS.log.
